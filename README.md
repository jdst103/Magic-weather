# Magic-weather

## Make a weather/clothing game ## project
Made a program to ask for user input and depending on the response advise on their attire. I prompt user for input and evaluated each input and print the appropriate responses.

E.g -- > weather = input('Whats the weather like? I can give you advice. :)')

##Learning Outcomes
making my program 'on' intially as default.
IF statements.
Added to GIT AND GITHUB.
Created a markdown file called README.md.

##Rules applied for game:
Follow these rules:

when sunny >> respond with 'take your shorts!'

stormy >> respond with 'take rain coat'

rainy >> respond with 'Take your umbrella'

rainy and stormy >> 'stay home'

anything else respond with 'sorry, I didn't quite catch that'

Make it so you keep playing until we say: 'No more Magic'
